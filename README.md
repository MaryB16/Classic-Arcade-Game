# Classic-Arcade-Game
This is the 4th project that I did for Udacity Front-End program during my  Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship.

## Description
This project is similar to the classic arcade game Frogger. The rules are simple: 
* The player moves his character with arrow keys.
* If he steps on water he loses one life, if he encounters an enemy, he loses one life.
* The player gathers gems for points, he wins the game once he has gathered enough gems.

## How to run the game
This project was written in Visual Studio IDE and contains some extra files. These files are **not needed**  to run the project or modify it. 
In order to run the project all you need are the *following files*:
- `index.html`
- `css` folder (which includes style.css)
- `js` folder  (which includes 3 js files: app.js, engine.js, resources.js)
- `images` folder (which includes all the images needed to run the game)

  In order to run the game just download in the same folder: `index.html`, `css` folder, `js` folder, `images` folder. 
  Open `index.html` with browser.  The game runs best with chrome browser.
