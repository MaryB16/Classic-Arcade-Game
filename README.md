# Classic-Arcade-Game([demo](https://maryb16.github.io/Classic-Arcade-Game/))
This is the 4th project that I did for Udacity Front-End program during my  Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship.

## Live demo
You can test the game [here](https://maryb16.github.io/Classic-Arcade-Game/)

## Description
This project is similar to the classic arcade game Frogger. 
* You can select a player from the character selection screen
* You move the character with arrow keys. If he steps on water he loses one life, if he encounters an enemy, he loses one life.
* You gather points by collecting gems that are generated randomly on the canvas.
* In order to win you have to gather a certain amount of points.

## Code acknowledgement
* This app uses  a *game loop engine* and *assests* provided by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)
